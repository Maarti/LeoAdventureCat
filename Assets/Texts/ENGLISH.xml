		<!--Story1-->
		<text key="TUTO_JUMP">This cliff is too high, I do not want to fall again, I should rather climb by jumping...</text>
		<text key="TUTO_ATTACK">It's a dead end.
Unless...
The rock looks crumbly, I can try to dig.</text>
		<text key="TUTO_KITTYZ">Nice, a Kittyz! I can collect it, I would probably need it later.</text>
		<text key="TUTO_ENNEMY_1">Argh! Snake!</text>
		<text key="TUTO_ENNEMY_2">I'd better take advantage of the surprise effect and attack it before it does...</text>
		<text key="TUTO_CHECKPOINT">A checkpoint, I could easily find this point if something ever happened to me...</text>
		<text key="FIRST_HEDGEHOG_1">What kind of beast is this? It looks cool!</text>
		<text key="FIRST_HEDGEHOG_2">Not as cool as I thought...</text>
		<text key="FIRST_SQUIRREL">That glouton does not even look where he throws his hazelnuts!</text>
		<text key="DOG_CATCHER_START">Another stray cat... 
Kitty kitty! Come here!
I'm almost not going to hurt you.</text>
		<!--Story2-->
		<text key="RAT_ASKS_HELP">Please, help me!</text>
		<text key="RAT_THANKS_CAT">Thank you from the bottom of my whiskers!
I will help you out.</text>
		<text key="RAT_ASKS_FOLLOW">Follow me, hurry up!</text>
		<text key="RAT_ASKS_WAIT">Hold on! We forgot something important.</text>
		<text key="RAT_READY">All right, we can go!</text>
		<text key="RAT_FINISHED_CHEESE">What a delight...
What? We're still not out ?!
Oh I forgot to tell you that I had the key to open the door of the ground floor.
Too bad, we will have to find another solution.</text>
		<text key="RAT_GO_TO_VENTILATION">We must find a way to activate this blower to access the roof.</text>
		<text key="RAT_START_VENTILATION_GAME">Wow! It's blowing hard here!
I will need your help to guide the direction of ventilation.</text>
		<text key="RAT_START_BULLDOG">Oops... This one does not want to go get the ball...</text>

		<text key="RAT_HIDING_PLACE">I've never seen such an agile and determined cat. I'll have to change my hiding place now...</text>
	<!--Help-->
   <text key="HELP_SNAKE">These long snakes wander in the forest. Be careful, some are more robust than others and they sometimes move in groups.</text>
   <text key="HELP_HEDGEHOG">Hedgehogs seem friendly but will charge you if they see you! They are unbeatable when they are charging, better dodge or attack them from behind.</text>
   <text key="HELP_SQUIRREL">Peaceful and hungry, squirrels are not a threat. However it is necessary to pay attention to the hazelnuts that they drop. It seems that some of them would take pleasure in targeting you ...</text>
   <text key="HELP_WASP">Wasps are slow but are able to launch their darts over long distances, be careful where you land.</text>
   <text key="HELP_DOGCATCHER">The dog-catcher is a little bit lazy but armed with a very powerful vacuum cleaner. It is better to go away when he equips himself with it.</text>
    <text key="HELP_CROC">Croc the rat is very agile but a bit of scatterbrain. He is never out of ideas.</text>
   <text key="HELP_BARKINGDOG">The barking of this guard dog is formidable! It is best to remain at a safe distance before attacking him at the right time.</text>
   <text key="HELP_WATCHDOG">A very friendly dog who only thinks of playing. Find a ball and it's in the bag!</text>
   <text key="HELP_CAGEBEAST">Mysterious creature, it is better not to try to face it and to dodge it when it lowers its vigilance.</text>
   <text key="HELP_BULLDOG">This huge, very powerful dog is stubborn, but not very clever. However you will need a companion to overcome it.</text>
