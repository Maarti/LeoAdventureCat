# When building with Gradle, analysis of Unity IAP's Java purchasing support libraries can
# result in fatal build warnings and errors. These can be safely ignored. 
# 
# To ignore:
# 1. Paste the contents of this file into your project's "Assets/Plugins/UnityPurchasing/Android/proguard-user.txt" 
#    file.
# 2. Confirm that "User Proguard File" is enabled (Player Settings > Android > Publishing Settings > 
#    User Proguard File).
# 3. Build.
#
# Note this ProGuard flag suppresses often helpful warnings seen when incorporating Java into projects.
